He was lighthearted and swift, often flitting from branch to branch, curious about the world but careful not to settle down too soon. One fateful morning, he met a magpie with feathers as dark as night and eyes that gleamed like stolen stars. She sang a song so captivating that, for a moment, the sparrow stopped to listen.\n“You and I,” said the magpie, “should share a nest. Together, we could craft a melody that echoes across the woods.”\nThe sparrow, entranced by the thought, agreed without hesitation. But as the day wore on, he realised the magpie’s melody was not quite what he imagined. Her notes clashed with his rhythm, her perch too sharp for his tender claws. By sunset, the sparrow knew he had been too hasty.\n“I am sorry,” he told the magpie. “I spoke too quickly. I don’t think we are meant to sing together.”\nBut the magpie’s eyes flashed, her wings trembling with rage. “You dare to fly away?” she screeched. “You promised a duet!”\nThe sparrow tried to explain, but the magpie was not one to listen. In her fury, she soared to the tallest tree in the forest, calling out to all the creatures below. “Hear me, everyone! This sparrow is a traitor! A liar! He led me to believe we’d build a future, only to abandon me!” And with that, she scattered the sparrow’s feathers—pieces of his name, his story, his very essence—into the winds.\nAt first, the sparrow was stunned. He perched on a low branch, watching as squirrels chattered, foxes whispered, and owls hooted, their eyes glinting with curiosity. But then, something happened. The creatures of the forest, wise from seasons of rumour and deceit, began to see through the magpie’s game.\n“Wait,” said the owl, “didn’t she once try to stir up drama about the jay in the group chat?”\n“And the robin!” added a chipmunk. “Remember how she even sent shiny coins to get everyone to pay attention, but no one cared?”\nThe creatures began to laugh, their chatter turning against the magpie. Her plan to humiliate the sparrow had backfired. She fluttered away, defeated, while the sparrow, though shaken, remained untouched.\nAs he flew back to his favourite branch, the sparrow reflected on what had happened. His feathers were ruffled, his song quieter, but he realised the magpie’s storm had passed without leaving scars. He thought of the creatures who had defended him, who saw through the magpie’s rage, and felt a warmth in his chest.\n“Sometimes,” he thought, “the truth doesn’t need to be shouted. It just needs to be seen.”\nAnd so, the sparrow sang again—not for the magpie, nor for the crowd, but for himself. His notes were steady, his rhythm true. And though the magpie’s cries echoed faintly in the distance, they no longer mattered.\nThe forest, after all, had already made its judgment.\n","wordCount":"499","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65b05aee-0ca6-47db-bd3f-22404c91b445","datePublished":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ziheng Zhang"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zzheng2020.github.io/post/the_tale_of_the_hasty_sparrow_and_the_angry_magpie/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ziheng Zhang's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zzheng2020.github.io/favicon/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Ziheng (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zzheng2020.github.io/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Ziheng</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/post/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zzheng2020.github.io/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The Tale of the Hasty Sparrow and the Angry Magpie</h1><div class=post-description>When the storm passes, clarity remains.
